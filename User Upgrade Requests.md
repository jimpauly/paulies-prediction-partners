Upgrade Requests

1. Header bar:

- robot emoji should go after 'paulie's prediction partners' remove the 'prediction trading'; no subtext needed.
- set a placeholder circle in the center of header bar.

- Illumination control panel:
  - make 'illumination control panel' instead be a header on the left side of this card. Have Illumination be vertically read like it looks like a stickered label.
  - remake the switch for the Day/NVG toggle, it looks weird, make it look like the other switches in this control-panel; it looks like it has two switches for only one action;
  - let's have all flip-switches be horizontal, and they should flip up and down for on and off; we do not need labels for on and off. Let people discover it.
  - the channel labels; can we move them to the left of their channel, and then can they be vertically-read; this will give us more height for more detail on our elements if we want.
  - ensure the height of the flip-switch housing is the same height and as the dimmer switches plus the dimmer switch's intensity sub labels.
  - can we refactor the dimmers so instead of 100% it is simply 10. the values should present to the nearest round number. intensity values should reflect the intensity values and should go from 10 to 2.5; i know that doesnt make sense, just trust me.
  - i like the design and archicture of all this, let's ensure the colors pull from the active theme palette tho, it is currently staticly colored.


2. Nav Bar
  - rename "HUD'
  - Move tabs and tab functionality into the header of the main region
  - make ping go up and down in curvy motions slowly and shorten it's width a little, i guess that means show less time history or something. keep the chart static y axis from 0ms to 300 ms, then flip the values; what that means is 0ms is at the top of the y axis and 300ms is at the bottom with the x axis for like the past maybe 30 seconds, let's try 30 seconds and see how it looks after all these tweaks. dont label or line the x or y axis, leave the sparkline cute with only ping as the label

3. System Design (side bar):

- Modes:
  - Let's make light/dark one single button in the same row next to it, should be a single button for 3d/2d toggle. rename this card with these two updated buttons 'modes'.
- Themes:
  - let's make the text inside the theme buttons also have a border. this way the button can show the theme's background color, it's body color, and two border colors if applicable.
  - set theme button's outer borders right angles, almost touching, the inner text borders can be slightly rounded.
  - keep theme buttons in single column and equal widths. the button width could be reactive to the width of the widest or longest text;
  - this means our text in the theme buttons could be shrinkwrapped, then the themes card could shrink wrap reactively with the buttons, then the left-side-bar could be shrinkwrapped to the
  - After this, for each theme ensure the color palette is accurate according to the PRD in chapter 1. where it gives the descriptions for each theme.
  - when switching themes the typography is changed which is nice, yet it changes the text size sometimes. Can we ensure if a different font is wanted, it has to be one size smaller or larger to match the size we have for webpage-modern-default

4. Right Side Bar

- Let's set the text toggle buttons and tools underneath the notepad.
- move the new file and save file function into a file dropdown menu at the top left on top of notepad.
- there are rings on top of the notepad, this was an attempt to look like a spiral notebook,
- the send an idea card should be set at the bottom of the inspector panel.
  - the notebook paper should raise/lower vertically with the changing height of the inspector panel to fill any vertical space (it shouldn;t change the width of the lines on the paper it should still feel college ruled under the header input line.
  - remove the text 'Have an idea for Paulie's? Send it our way!' and it needs a text box that just says 'type complaints here'. This all needs to be cynical but not too negative.

5. Bottom bar (Hangar Bay):

- in agent access card: Add 2 more agents spaces for a total of 7 agents. rename agents 4. `Patiens`, 5. 'Pavis', 6. 'Bring-Your-Own-Bot', and 7. 'agnt007`. 
  - bring your own bot has a button that opens a menu (make sure this doesn't change the size of the card, also all agent cards should be same sizes)
    - the menu that opens has a text input that has functions as a coding-editor with no additional crazy features just blank beyond the numbered lines (as if we are in a basic yet still pretty version vim)
    - under the menu is a grayed out button that says 'plug in algorithm' (keep this button grayed out, this does nothing, if they want to input a code, which they won't, no one will ask me why can't i add my own bot, which no one will for a really long time.
  - selector radio buttons under the 'plug in algorithm' for the 7 toppest-performing AI models for 2026 feb (claude cannot have more than 1 button, all claude models should work under the claude button.)
    - after inputting 'LLM API keys' (we cannot say AI anywhere), then agent 6 is fully hooked up and fully functional through that person's personal AI's API keys.
  - Agent cards for 4, 5, and 7 are disabled with consturction emojis and your idea too how to make it cutely displayed that we are working on these remaining 3.
- Move P/L-Multi-Funtion-Display into bottom bar directly after the agent access card.
  - agents access card should take up around 50% width of the bottom bar, shared with the P/L MFD that should take up the remainin 50%; the other cards go after and can be seen if horizontally scrolled.
  - P/L MFD has to be the equal heights as the cards in the bottom bar, this might be tricky, please research what mfds look like and look through our insiration photos
- after agent access card is around 50% width, refactor agent containers to feel comfortably fit in this new design. 

6. Action Bar (Throttle):

- Let's redesign our throttle to look hilariously over-detailed and over-developed for no reason; i placed 2 new png files for engine-control and engine-order are in the documents in inspiration photos
- Keep only the 3 states
- apply backlight glow like there is an old light illuminating the interface, not the casing but the text and the markings on the face of the dial.
- keep the coloring matching with the active themes.

7. Main region:

- system gauges take 2 seconds to catch up to system theme changes.
- Theme palette card: place as first card
  - rename to 'Active Palette'
  - remove the hex codes (just make a function where hex code is auto copied to clipboard, dont explain it anywhere, until they click it then it's 'color copied to clipboard', just let them figure it out)
  - replace the name of the selectors with more common ways of wording what it is the selector is, because i have no idea, i dont speak code. My grandmas will be using this website, please keep them in mind.
- so i want the theme palettes card first. To the right of theme palettes should be both cards: system gauges which should be called 'man-o-meters' above 'live logs'; both these cards to the right of 'active paletts', ms word underneath the first 3 cards.


Please update the original 0-PRD with these upgraded ideas using the same brief-nested ideas.
